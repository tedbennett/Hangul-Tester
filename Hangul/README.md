## 가자! - Learn Hangul

가자 (*Kaja*, "let's do it!") is a flashcard app to learn Hangul, the Korean alphabet.

### Description

Test yourself and learn the characters of the Hangul alphabet.

### Future work
- Storing users 'scores', i.e characters which they are weak or strong with.
- Adding support for Japanese hiragana and katakana
  - Having a switch between languages in a menu somewhere
  - Would be named 頑張って(*ganbatte*, "do your best!"), probably stylised in hiragana as がんばって
- Device rotation support
